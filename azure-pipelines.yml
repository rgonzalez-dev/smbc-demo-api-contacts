# Azure Pipelines Configuration - Multiple Deployment Options
#
# This repository contains three separate Azure Pipelines configurations:
#
# 1. azure-pipelines-aks.yml
#    - For Kubernetes (AKS) deployments
#    - Builds Docker image and pushes to container registry
#    - Deploys to AKS cluster
#    - Registers API in Azure API Management (APIM)
#    - Use this pipeline for production K8s deployments
#
# 2. azure-pipelines-webapp.yml
#    - For Azure App Service (Web App) deployments
#    - Builds JAR artifact
#    - Deploys to App Service with proper startup command
#    - Verifies deployment status
#    - Use this pipeline for Web App deployments
#
# 3. azure-pipelines-container-apps.yml
#    - For Azure Container Apps deployments
#    - Builds Docker image and pushes to container registry
#    - Creates/manages Container Apps environment
#    - Deploys container and handles scaling
#    - Verifies deployment and tests health endpoint
#    - Use this pipeline for serverless container deployments
#
# How to Configure in Azure Pipelines:
#
# For AKS Deployment:
#   1. Go to Azure Pipelines
#   2. Create new pipeline
#   3. Select "Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file"
#   4. Choose "azure-pipelines-aks.yml"
#   5. Configure variables:
#      - AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY: your-registry.azurecr.io
#      - Ensure service connections exist: AzureContainerRegistry, AKS-Connection
#
# For Web App Deployment:
#   1. Go to Azure Pipelines
#   2. Create new pipeline
#   3. Select "Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file"
#   4. Choose "azure-pipelines-webapp.yml"
#   5. Configure variables in the YAML:
#      - WEBAPP_NAME: your actual App Service name
#      - RESOURCE_GROUP: your resource group name
#      - Ensure service connection exists: AzureServiceConnection
#
# For Container Apps Deployment:
#   1. Go to Azure Pipelines
#   2. Create new pipeline
#   3. Select "Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file"
#   4. Choose "azure-pipelines-container-apps.yml"
#   5. Configure variables in the YAML:
#      - containerAppName: desired container app name
#      - containerAppEnvironment: environment name
#      - resourceGroup: your resource group
#      - location: Azure region (eastus, westus, etc.)
#   6. Ensure service connections exist: AzureContainerRegistry, AzureServiceConnection
#
# Environment Configuration:
#
# For Web App deployments, configure these application settings in App Service:
#   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
#   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME
#   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
#   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_DRIVER_CLASS_NAME=org.postgresql.Driver
#   - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production (or your target profile)
#
# For Container Apps deployments, configure via Azure CLI or Portal:
#   - Environment variables in container app settings
#   - ConfigMaps and Secrets for sensitive data
#   - Scaling rules based on CPU/memory/HTTP requests
#
# For AKS deployments, configure these in deployment manifests (k8s/*.yaml):
#   - Environment variables in pod spec
#   - ConfigMaps and Secrets for sensitive data
#
# VS Code Deployment:
#
# For direct VS Code deployment to Container Apps, see:
#   AZURE_CONTAINER_APPS_DEPLOYMENT.md
#
# This provides step-by-step instructions for:
#   1. Building and pushing Docker images
#   2. Creating Container Apps environment
#   3. Deploying container apps with VS Code extensions
#   4. Configuring environment variables and scaling
#   5. Troubleshooting and monitoring
#   - ConfigMaps and Secrets for sensitive data
